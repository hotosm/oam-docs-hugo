      <description>OpenAerialMap Ecosystem Imagery from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other aircraft is becoming increasingly available after a disaster. It is often difficult to determine what is available and easily access it. OpenAerialMap (OAM) seeks to solve this by providing a simple open way to host and provide access to imagery for humanitarian response and disaster preparedness.
OpenAerialMap relies on a set of open source tools to accomplish its goals. These components can be divided into two main functionalities:</description>

      <description>OpenAerialMap Uploader The OAM imagery database is made up of the contributions of users.

The OAM uploader consists of two different tools:
 the upload form and the server to glue everything together  </description>

      <description>Catalog Components Components that index and serve imagery metadata. The Open Imagery Network (OIN) specification allows providers to annotate their imagery with metadata and register them to the network in a standard way. The OAM Catalog is a collection of OIN spec&amp;rsquo;d metadata.
OAM API The OAM API is the main component of this group. It contains two sub-components that work together to provide imagery metadata to users: The worker and the catalog API.</description>

      <description>Contributor Components Components that allow a contributor to add data to the system through an upload form. The data is added to the HOTOSM imagery bucket. Contributors with a large amount of imagery should consider setting up their own imagery bucket within the OIN network.
OAM Uploader A web form that a contributor can use to add datasets to OpenAerialMap.

      <description>OpenAerialMap Browser Imagery from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other aircraft are becoming available at ever increasing rates. It is often difficult to determine what is available and easily access it.
The OAM Browser aims to provide a simple way to find and access aerial imagery.
It features an interactive grid that simplifies the process of finding imagery for a particular location, and a set of filters that allow you to refine the search even further.</description>

      <description>OpenAerialMap API OpenAerialMap API is an application programming interface (API) that serves metadata about available images and map layers. The API provides access to all imagery metadata information and endpoints to list images available, map layer services available, as well as simple analytics.
Quick Start The API is split into three available endpoints:
 a metadata endpoint /meta a tiled map service (TMS) listing endpoint /tms and an analytics endpoint /analytics  To get started, you can access the metadata endpoint here: http://api.</description>

      <description>For development purposes, you can roll parts of OpenAerialMap locally. Detailed docs exist in the README section of each component. This document is an overview of the interdependencies and configuring the development environment as a functional whole.
Development Requirements   It will be necessary to use nvm during development - some applications will need Node v4, others will use Node v0.12
  In some components (the web frontends) configuration variables can be added to app/assets/scripts/config/local.</description>

      <description>The Tiler is the tool and API to generate tiled map service endpoints from OAM imagery.
See oam-server-tiler, oam-server-api, and oam-server-cli for details on the OAM Tiler components.
The OpenAerialMap Mosaic has documentation for filtering the mosaic as Swagger.</description>

      <description>The upload form is the way for users to contribute to the OAM imagery database. Besides uploading the imagery itself, contributors need to provide metadata for imagery datasets. There are two types of fields for filling in the metadata: fields for input values (Title, Sensor, Provider, Tags, Contact info) and fields with choices (Platform, Date start, Date end, Contact, License).
Also, there is an opportunity to upload several imagery datasets by clicking on the &amp;ldquo;New dataset&amp;rdquo; button.</description>

      <description>How to use? OAM can be used with a web browser. Simply search by location to find imagery available in a given area of interest. Each area can be selected to view available imagery as well as details about each image.
The OAM search interface focuses on two main core functions:
 Searching by location and metadata Using available imagery  OAM can be used within any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).</description>
